# Pipelines

Here are scripts and pipelines to run `hloc` on other datasets. Installing the toolbox locally is required, by running the following command from the main directory:
```bash
pip3 install -e .
```
# 
To use the run\_all\_pipelines, make sure to run 
```bash
python initialize_datasets.py 
    --dataset <dataset_base_dir> \
    --outputs outputs/
```
